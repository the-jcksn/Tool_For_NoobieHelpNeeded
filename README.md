# Tool_For_NoobieHelpNeeded
Generates all possible combinations of the password you asked for

You might want to edit the list of special character in the script (called 'special') and add some or take some out, depending on which ones you think he might have used.

How to use this?
>1. Download the passgen.py script
>
>2. In the same directory that you have saved the script make a list of words, one per line, that you think might be the 'english word' - no need to capitalise them, the script does this bit for you
>
>3. Save that list as something like 'wordlist.txt'
>
>4. Run the script
>
>5. When it asks you, provide the full name of the wordlist you made (in the same directory)
>
>6. All possible combinations following your rules will be output to the terminal and also saved to 'output.txt' in the current directory.
>
>7. This generates a LOT of possible passwords with very few words in the input list. You will need to be specific with your guesses for the english words in the list.

Enjoy
