# Tool_For_NoobieHelpNeeded
Generates all possible combinations of the password you asked for

How to use this?
>Download the passgen.py script
>In the same directory that you have saved the script make a list of words, one per line, that you think might be the 'english word' - no need to capitalise them, the script does this bit for you
>Save that list as something like 'wordlist.txt'
>Run the script
>When it asks you, provide the full name of the wordlist you made (in the same directory)
>All possible combinations following your rules will be output to the terminal and also saved to 'output.txt' in the current directory.
>This generates a LOT of possible passwords with very few words in the input list. You will need to be specific with your guesses for the english words in the list.

Enjoy
